The project is based on a fake gym academy where we can simulate a management of theirs students, teachers, payments and so on. 
It would be amazing if each module was in an API application, 
just like a microservices. For while I am using a buint in PHP server to do
this separation, but in the future the ideia is to put each server in a docker envoriment

# Features and ideias
* Http Router
* Acl with reader and writer permissions
* Consice and simple API error control 
* Correct use of http codes
* Rest API between system modules
